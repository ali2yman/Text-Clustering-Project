         "do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law honestly the word of sin is restriction would i kid you does one mans words encompass the majestic vision of thousands of individuals quoting a man is not the same as quoting the order taken out of context words can be interpreted much differently than had one applied them within the confines of their original expression i think this is the case regarding hymenaeus beta frater superior of the order to which i belong when he included that bit from merlinus x he did us all a service he showed us the extremes to which order members have been known to go in their fervor i have little knowledge regarding reuss background but surely he was an unusual man and he was an important force in the order for many years yet as people change so do orders change and while we look back so carefully at the dirty laundry of oto remember that this is only the surface skim and that many perspectives are now encompassed which extend beyond any one individual i hope to show that there was and is much room for a difference of opinion within the order itself perhaps by testing the limits myself let us examine this issue a bit more closely in karl kellner a wealthy austrian industrialist and paper chemist as well as a highgrade mason founded the ordo templi orientis kellner had traveled widely in the east where he met three adepts who instructed him specific magical practices kellners efforts to develop the order were later assisted by franz hartmann heinrich klein and theodore reuss who had worked together prior to joining the oto the order was first proclaimed in in reusss masonic publication oriflamme on kellners death reuss succeeded him as outer head oho the jubilee edition of the oriflamme published in announced that the order taught secret of sexual magic theodore reuss was an interesting character born june in augsburg he entered masonry in he was a singer journalist and possibly a spy for the prussian political police infiltrating the socialist league founded by karl marxs daughter and her husband reuss was later associated with william wynn westcott a leader of the golden dawn who later introduced him to john yarker yarker chartered reuss to found the rites of memphis and mizraim in germany after several attempts to concretize various masonic rites reuss settled on the development of the oto the order experienced reasonably steady growth under reuss leadership for example he chartered papus in france rudolph steiner in berlin and h spencer lewis in the usa in the historic meeting between reuss and crowley occurred crowley wrote that reuss came to him and accused him of revealing order secrets when crowley looked at it afresh the initiated interpretation of sexual magick unfolded itself to him for the first time reuss appointed crowley as supreme and holy king of all the english speaking world and it was this authorization that he invoked when publishing the material of the equinox reuss resigned as outer head of the order in after suffering a stroke and named crowley his successor all was well until when the book of the law was translated into german there was a break in the continuity of the order manyk members split with the new oho over the book which crowley was actively promulgating through the order he had earlier revise dthe order rituals at reusss request deeply infusing the doctrines of the new aeon revelation an introduction to the history of the oto by ad veritatem ix within equinox iii edited by hymenaeus beta frater superior rex summus sanctissimus caliph of the united states of america published by samuel weiser there are many possible reasons that our frater superior included this material in equinox iii and this is the real point is it not why did he wish to publish such things about the history of his own organization does he represent a dogmatic threat to the principle of thelema or is he exercising his true will and putting forth very complex pictures with no easy answers a picture which leaves room for very many interpretations it is quite easy for me to see for example that all of oto derived out of the dribble of faltering masonry purchased by clever hucksters with an ounce of courage and some writing ability to aid them and i can take that all the way down to our present caliph whose feeble support of the law of thelema is laughable at best would i be thrown out of the order for speaking in this way will i i think not why because my frater will see it as a perspective an interjection i am using as an example my illustration shows that we may express things in the context of a larger work and the true significance of this may be quite difficult to apprehend at first so it may be with oto and merlinus x please look oto more carefully i do not support reusss words myself as i am not qualified to assess them and i am critical of their pomposity if i who am a member of the order take such a stand and am allowed to continue doing so then what can this say about the health of the order does it mean that the order has gone soft and abandoned its moral principles or does it mean that it is strong in its ability to let the will of universal kinship arise on its own not shackled by some dogmatic requirement how shall we resolve these two possibilities i find a high calibre of individual associated with ordo templi orientis they are often quite intelligent and sometimes very well versed in arcane or usual information they are quite often artists and geniuses having met some longstanding members in the sf bay area many who are or were very heavily involved with the order i can vouch for the integrity of the organization as it stands i have sometimes questioned the policy of hymenaeus beta in these moments i followed my intuition and ive found little to stop me from requesting a second initiation from a different oto body im happily participating in social groups feasts or initiations and have come to know the gnostic mass well enough for my tastes this doesnt make me an authority on order politics and explanations however i can only hypothesize and relay to you what i understand based on my limited contact with other members i urge you not to take the words of merlinus x too far there are many ways to interpret words and many people who have become involved with the order feel very strongly about the sanctity of personal freedom and the preservation of individual vision i welcome other comment on this issue and will be writing more in response to other posts in this thread invoke me under my stars love is the law love under will i am i",

         "rick anderson replied to my letter with ra in article celplcacsubuffaloedu ra ra well jason its heretical in a few ways the first point is that ra this equates lucifer and jesus as being the same type of being ra however lucifer is a created being thou wast perfect in thy ra ways from the day that thou wast created till iniquity was found in ra thee ezekiel while jesus is uncreated and the creator of ra all things in the beginning was the word and the word was with ra god and the word was god the same was in the beginning with god ra all things were made by him and without him was not any thing made ra that was made john and he is before all things and by ra him all things consist colossians ra ra your inference from the ezekiel and john passages that lucifer was ra created and that jesus was not depends on a particular interpetation of ra the word create one with which many christians may not agree ra granted the mormon belief that all of gods children including christ ra and lucifer are eternally existent intelligences which were organized ra into spirit children by god the term creation can apply equally well ra to both of those passages just briefly on something that you mentioned in passing you refer to differing interpretations of create and say that many christians may not agree so what that is really irrelevant we do not base our faith on how many people think one way or another do we the bottom line is truth regardless of popularity of opinions also i find it rather strange that in trying to persuade that created and eternally existent are equivalent you say granted the mormon belief you cant grant your conclusion and then expect the point to have been addressed in order to reply to the issue you have to address and answer the point that was raised and not just jump to the conclusion that you grant the bible states that lucifer was created the bible states that jesus is the creator of all the contradiction that we have is that the lds belief is that jesus and lucifer were the same ra your point that we all are brothers of jesus and lucifer is also ra heretical since we are not innately brothers and sisters of christ ra we are adopted for ye have not received the spirit of bondage ra again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby ra we cry abba father romans and not the natural children ra of god it is only through faith that we even enter the family of ra god for ye are all the children of god by faith in christ jesus ra galatians and it is only through the manifestation of this ra faith in receiving jesus that we are become the sons of god but ra as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of ra god even to them that believe on his name which were born not ra of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but ra of god john ra ra has it occured to you robert that being born of someone or being ra of that person or persons family may be a symbolic term in the new ra testament mormons believe that we are adopted into the house of ra israel through baptism and faith in christ although some have expressed ra belief that this does evince a physical change in our bodies the mormon belief is that all are children of god literally there is nothing symbolic about it this however contradicts what the bible says the bible teaches that not everyone is a child of god the field is the world the good seed are the children of the kingdom but the tares are the children of the wicked one matthew i speak that which i have seen with my father and ye do that which ye have seen with your father john ye do the deeds of your father then said they to him we be not born of fornication we have one father even god jesus said unto them if god were your father ye would love me for i proceeded forth and came from god neither came i of myself but he sent me why do ye not understand my speech even because ye cannot hear my word ye are of your father the devil and the lusts of your father ye will do he was a murderer from the beginning and abode not in the truth because there is no truth in him when he speaketh a lie he speaketh of his own for he is a liar and the father of it john and said o full of all subtilty and all mischief thou child of the devil thou enemy of all righteousness wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the lord acts wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience ephesians in this the children of god are manifest and the children of the devil whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of god neither he that loveth not his brother john one becomes a child of god but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of god even to them that believe on his name john behold what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of god therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him not beloved now are we the sons of god and it doth not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is john when he is born again through faith in jesus christ which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of god john having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will ephesians of his own will begat he us with the word of truth that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures james for as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba father the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of god romans beloved let us love one another for love is of god and every one that loveth is born of god and knoweth god john whosoever believeth that jesus is the christ is born of god and every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him john for ye are all the children of god by faith in christ jesus galatians ra we are told that and this is life eternal that they might know ra thee the only true god and jesus christ whom thou hast sent ra john life eternal is to know the only true god yet the ra doctrines of the lds that i have mentioned portray a vastly ra different jesus a jesus that cannot be reconciled with the jesus of ra the bible they are so far removed from each other that to proclaim ra one as being true denies the other from being true according to the ra bible eternal life is dependent on knowing the only true god and ra not the construct of imagination ra ra ra robert with all due respect who died and left you chief arbiter of ra correct biblical interpretation i dont mean to be snotty about this ra but the fact is that the bible is so differently interpreted by different ra groups of biblical scholars what do you think of the jehovahs ra witnesses for example that to make reference to the jesus of the ra bible is simply ridiculous whose jesus of the bible do you mean this is really a red herring it doesnt address any issue raised but rather it seeks to obfuscate the fact that some groups try to read something into the bible doesnt change what the bible teaches for example the fact that the jehovahs witnesses deny the deity of christ does not alter what the bible teaches looking for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing of the great god and our saviour jesus christ titus simon peter a servant and an apostle of jesus christ to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of god and our saviour jesus christ peter on the deity of christ we first look to the bible to see what it teaches to discount or not even address what the bible teaches because there are some groups that have differing views is selfdefeating to see what the bible teaches you have to look at the bible ra our lords mortality was essential to his own salvation the ra promised messiah p he had to work out his own salvation by ra doing the will of the father in all things ibid p he had ra to be baptized to gain admission to the celestial kingdom mormon ra doctrine p ra ra welcome to the wonderful world of mormon paradoctrine robert the ra above books are by the late bruce r mcconkie a former general authority ra of the lds church those books were not published by the church nor do ra they constitute offical doctrine they consist of his opinions now ra does that mean that what he says is not true not at all ill have to ra think about the idea of christs personal salvation before i come to any ra conclusions myself the conclusions i come to may seem heretical to ra you but im prepared to accept that i find this rather curious when i mentioned that the mormon belief is that jesus needed to be saved i put forward some quotes from the late apostle bruce mcconkie the curious part is that no one addressed the issue of jesus needing to be saved rick comes the closest with his i have my own conclusions to addressing the point most of the other replies have instead hopscotched to the issue of bruce mcconkie and whether his views were official doctrine i dont think that it matters if mcconkies views were canon that is not the issue were mcconkies writings indicative of mormon belief on this subject is the real issue the indication from rick is that they may certainly be",

         "i think the passage youre looking for is the following matthew think not that i have come to abolish the law and the prophets i have come not to abolish them but to fulfil them matthew for truly i say to you till heaven and earth pass away not an iota not a dot will pass from the law until all is accomplished matthew whoever then relaxes one of the least of these commandments and teaches men so shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven but he who does them and teaches them shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven matthew for i tell you unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and pharisees you will never enter the kingdom of heaven there are several problems with this the most serious is that the law was regarded by jews at the time and now as binding on jews but not on gentiles there are rules that were binding on all human beings the socalled noachic laws but they are quite minimal the issue that the church had to face after jesus death was what to do about gentiles who wanted to follow christ the decision not to impose the law on them didnt say that the law was abolished it simply acknowledged that fact that it didnt apply to gentiles this is a simple answer which i think just about everyone can agree to a discussion of the issue in more or less these terms is recorded in acts however theres more involved in order to get a full picture of the role of the law we have to come to grips with pauls apparent rejection of the law and how that relates to jesus commendation of the law at least as i read paul he says that the law serves a purpose that has been in a certain sense superceded again this issue isnt one of the abolition of the law in the middle of his discussion paul notes that he might be understood this way and assures us that thats not what he intends to say rather he sees the law as primarily being present to convict people of their sinfulness but ultimately its an impossible standard and one that has been superceded by christ pauls comments are not the worlds clearest here and not everyone agrees with my reading but the interesting thing to notice is that even this radical position does not entail an abolition of the law it still remains as an uncompromising standard from which not an iota or dot may be removed for its purpose of convicting of sin its important that it not be relaxed however for christians its not the end ultimately we live in faith not law while the theoretical categories they use are rather different in the end i think jesus and paul come to a rather similar conclusion the quoted passage from mat should be taken in the context of the rest of the sermon on the mount where jesus shows us how he interprets the law the not an iota or dot would suggest a rather literal reading but in fact thats not jesus approach jesus interpretations emphasize the intent of the law and stay away from the ceremonial details indeed he is well known for taking a rather free attitude towards the sabbath and kosher laws some scholars claim that mat needs to be taken in the context of st cent jewish discussions jesus accuses his opponents of caring about giving a tenth of even the most minor herbs but neglecting the things that really matter justice mercy and faith and caring about how cups and plates are cleaned but not about the fact that inside the people who use them are full of extortion and rapacity mat this and the discussion later in mat suggest that jesus has a very specific view of the law in mind and that when he talks about maintaining the law in its full strength he is thinking of these aspects of it pauls conclusion is similar while he talks about the law being superceded all of the specific examples he gives involve the ceremonial law such as circumcision and the sabbath he is quite concerned about maintaining moral standards the net result of this is that when paul talks about the law being superceded and jesus talks about the law being maintained i believe they are talking about different aspects of the law paul is embroiled in arguments about circumcision as is natural in letters responding to specific situations hes looking at the aspect of the law that is currently causing trouble the law as specifically jewish ceremonies he certainly does not intend to abolish divine standards of conduct on the other hand when jesus commends the law he seems to be talking the law in its broadest implications for morals and human relationships and deemphasizing those aspects that were later to give paul so much trouble",
